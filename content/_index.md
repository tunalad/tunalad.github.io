# Novica's website

{{< small "Full Stack Developer (in the making)" >}}

Hey there, welcome to my website! I'm just a dude that likes to make stuff that does some stuff.

You can check out stuff that I made on the [projects page](/projects). And if you're interested in my "history" of development, check out the [about page](/about).

Oh yeah, I'm also an artist! This page will focus only on the tech related stuff, so for the music and drawing stuff you can go [here](http://tunalad.xyz/).
